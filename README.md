# ALMA
The Advanced LASER Mining Array (ALMA) is a theoretical model of a Fiber LASER capable of mining ice water in space. This is being designed in the Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL. 

 A few examples that ALMA could mine are ice on the moon, C-type asteroids, comets, and other planetary bodies. There will be a downsized model of the LASER to help derive constants for the equations in the simulations and also for a proof-of-design. We are hoping the outcome will prove that you can use a FBL to mine ice water efficiently, with low energy and high output, in the vacuum of space. 
 
 The simulations will be based on the environment, meaning we can test the FBL in a vacuum, or on Venus. Decisions are still being made on what language and program to use for the simulations.
