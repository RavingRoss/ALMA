* check material=None is the same as preceding
* paraxial trace to be both axes
* alternate solution for intersect in spheroid (paraboloidal
  hyperhemispherical mirrors)
* finite/infinite focal/afocal object/image
  * implement afocal infinte last conjugate
* hyperhemispheric pupils
* fix extrinsic aberrations
* optimization +example (pickups, solves, asa, limits, variables)
* tolerancing +example (mc, inverse sensitivity)
* analyze mtf through focus plot
* analyze mtf at values vs image height
* speedup refract, intercept, propagate
* 3d plot
